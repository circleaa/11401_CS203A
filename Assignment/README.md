以下會概述作業內容以及要求
---
### Assignment I: 建立個人 GitHub Repository
- [Assignment I](AssignmentI)
- Create a GitHub account and the course repo 11401_CS203A.
- Enable GitHub Pages at https://{username}.github.io/.
- Add a meaningful README.md (name, student ID, course, brief description).
### Assignment II: Array Selection Sort
- [Assignment II](AssignmentII)
- Practice representing data in arrays, implement the selection sort algorithm step-by-step.
- Analyze algorithmic trade-offs including number of comparisons, swaps, and visualization of the sorting process.
### Assignment III: Linked List Selection Sort (Swap Value Version)
- [Assignment III](AssignmentIII)
- Prac ce represen ng data using a linked list, apply the selec on sort algorithm step by step.
- Analyze the differences between array and linked list implementations in terms of traversal, exchange cost, and computational overhead. 
### Assignment IV: Hash - Design your Hash Function
- [Assignment IV](AssignmentIV)
- Understand how the choice of hash function and table size (m) affects index distribution.
- Design and implement hash functions for both integer keys and string keys.
- Gain practical experience in creating and testing hash functions in C and C++.
- Analyze index patterns, collision rates, and distribution uniformity for various table sizes (m).
### Assignment V: Tree
- [Assignment V](AssignmentV)
- Understand and clearly define:
    - General tree
    - Binary tree 
    - Complete binary tree 
    - Binary search tree (BST) 
    - AVL tree 
    - Red-Black tree 
    - Max heap 
    - Min heap
- Build a hierarchy and transforma on path from the general tree to these variants, and explain how each variant adds more structure or constraints.
- Use a fixed list of integers to construct mul ple tree variants and visualize them.
- Choose one real-world applica on for each tree type and explain why that data structure fits the applica on.
- Practice using AI tools as study companions and keep a simple Q&A log.
